      "We felt it went extremely well and touched all the main points we wanted
      to have come across. It was clear you put a lot of effort into the
      presentation and demo and it clearly showed. I have spoken to a number of
      attendees following the meeting and all of their feedback has been
      positive! Thanks again for an excellent demo and great partnering!"

      "I think it's important to pass along how exceptional Duncan was in
      today's meeting. His depth of knowledge and professionalism/demeanor with
      the customer was outstanding. More importantly the customer noticed and
      commented several times. Double kudos because this ended up being
      completely non-standard. We didn't even finish the entire demo because
      they wanted to see specific things that fit specific use cases. He
      handled this beautifully. Duncan, extra thank you for joining us on your
      PTO day. I truly appreciate it and fantastic work. Thank you!!"
