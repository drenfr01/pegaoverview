    <h3>Biggest Challenges Going Forward</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>OOTB Demos have sharp edges</p>
    <br>
    <p>Often need product manager expertise which doesn't scale</p>
    <br>
    <p>Difficult to project completion dates for complex demos</p>

    <h3>Enablement Needs</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>List of features in the product with current status (R-Y-G)</p>
    <br>

    <h3>Management enabling SC Success</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>Huge gulf between training and practice (Pega is discovery vs. build)</p>
    <br>
    <p>Start new SCs with mentorship week or two (huge amount of tribal
    knowledge)</p>
    <br>
    <p>Rotational Program. Build bonds between Product Development, SE, AE, and
    SC teams</p>
    <br>
    <p>This is why Joao is so effective</p>
